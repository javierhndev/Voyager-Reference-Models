# Simple TensorFlow model
This is an example on how to run a python script that executes a deep learning model with TensorFlow on Voyager. The code shows how to implement a simple classification model used for computer vision. It uses the `Fashion-MNIST` dataset which consists of thousands of [Zalando's](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) article images.

The purpose of this code is to test TensorFlow with a very simple example.

Remember to change the path in `test_tf.yaml` to your own folder.
